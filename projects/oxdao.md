0xDAO describes itself as a [liquidity provider hub](https://medium.com/@0xdao/0xdao-a-liquidity-hub-for-solidly-made-with-love-by-fantom-builders-265b86130ec1) for Solidly on the Fantom network. They were
acquired by the DEUS team in Q2 2022.

## Involvement

## OXD PO6

The oxCouncil pitched a proposition to the 0xDAO team [1](https://twitter.com/oxcouncil/status/1521561217122414593) regarding upping the rewards
for native liquidity tokens on the 0xDAO protocol. The 0xDAO team accepted our
proposition and put it towards a governance vote.[2](https://snapshot.org/#/oxdaofi.eth/proposal/0x754c20fe5e717a469b3b5b824784c996d230f4c3ff19d09c4e7a7c1fc2486ffa)

OXD holders voted unanimously to pass the proposition which was merged a week later.[3](https://twitter.com/oxcouncil/status/1525158413906370560). [![The oxCouncil proposal](/assets/projects/oxcouncil_po6_tweet_small.png)](https://twitter.com/oxcouncil/status/1523815466535473152/photo/1)

The 0xDAO platform, OXD and oxSOLID stakers now enjoy a boost of rewards.
